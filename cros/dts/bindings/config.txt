=============================

Note: EFS mean Early Firmware Selection, where the read-only firmware runs
from internal on-chip ram (IRAM) instead of SDRAM.

cros-system-data-offset
  location (offset into DRAM and size) of the memory area allocated for
  crossystem data on Exynos platforms.

faft-key-remap-ascii - Array for simple ascii key remap.
 You may remap up to three keys if the GBB flag is set.
 Keys are paired with incoming key and remapped key.
 example remap '\' to SPACE:
     faft-key-remap-ascii = <0x5c 0x0D 0 0 0 0>;

faft-key-remap-special - Array for special key remap.
 You may remap up to three keys if the GBB flag is set.
 Keys are paired with incoming key and remapped key.
 Special keys are pre-stripped of ESCAPE and '['.
 example remap 'F9' to ENTER:
 faft-key-remap-special = <0x32 0x20 0 0 0 0>;

google-binary-block-offset
  location (offset into DRAM and size) of the memory area allocated for
  gbb on Exynos platforms.

kernel-offset
  location (offset into DRAM and size) of the memory area allocated for
  kernel blob on Exynos platforms.

skip-i8042
	If present, i8042 init is skipped, which means that an attached
	i8042 keyboard will not be activated.

usb-keyboard
	If present, indicates that the machine has a USB keyboard as the
	primary input, so it will be set up before boot proceeds.

early-firmware-selection
	Enable early firmware selection. This has the following effects:

	1. In the flashmap, the 'type,efs' property is used in preference
	to 'type'.

	2. In /config, u-boot-memory,efs and u-boot-offset,efs are used
	instead of  u-boot-memory and u-boot-offset.

	3. In vboot, RO firmware loads the RW spl regions instead of the
	RW boot regions.

early-firmware-verification
	Fully verify the U-Boot that SPL will load before returning success
	to vboot in VbExHashFirmwareBody().

disable-memory-clear
	Disable memory clear, ie, bypass function wipe_unused_memory(). This
	flag is useful for boards where memory clear is not absolutely needed
	because it may save a few seconds of booting time.
